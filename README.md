# DevOps-Projects
# Main Repository: DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure Projects Overview

Welcome to the main repository consolidating my diverse DevOps, cloud infrastructure, containerization, and automation projects. This collection reflects my hands-on experience and learning journey across modern development and operations practices, including Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), container orchestration, and automation tooling.

## About DevOps and My Journey

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement aimed at unifying software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, accelerate delivery, and ensure reliable software deployments. Throughout these projects, Iâ€™ve deepened my understanding of:

* Automating build, test, and deployment pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and AWS CodePipeline.
* Managing infrastructure programmatically with Terraform and AWS services.
* Containerizing applications using Docker and orchestrating deployments on Kubernetes.
* Automating configuration and environment setup using Ansible and Vagrant.
* Employing best practices for microservices deployment, networking, and security in cloud environments.
* Utilizing version control, static code analysis, and dynamic deployment strategies to support quality and agility.

## Projects Summary

### 1. Jenkins Pipeline Setup with GitHub Integration

Built a basic Jenkins pipeline to automate builds triggered by GitHub webhooks, SCM polling, periodic schedules, and remote API calls. This project established a foundational CI setup integrating Jenkins and GitHub.

### 2. GitOps-Based Infrastructure and Application Deployment on Kubernetes

Implemented a GitOps-driven CI/CD workflow using GitHub Actions, Terraform, Amazon EKS, Helm, and SonarCloud. The setup splits infrastructure and application repositories for modular, automated deployments to AWS EKS clusters.

### 3. Microservices-Based Web Application Deployment on Kubernetes

Deployed a Spring MVC microservices web application on Kubernetes, including backend services like MySQL, Memcached, RabbitMQ, and ElasticSearch, orchestrated via Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts.

### 4. VProfile Containerization Project

Containerized a multi-service Java web application stack using Docker and Docker Compose, transitioning from VM-based deployments to scalable, portable containers, facilitating DevOps practices and CI/CD readiness.

### 5. VPC and Networking Setup

Designed and configured a custom AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public/private subnets, NAT and Internet gateways, bastion host for secure SSH access, and an Application Load Balancer distributing traffic to private instances.

### 6. AWS CI/CD Project

Created a fully automated AWS CI/CD pipeline using Bitbucket repositories, AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and Elastic Beanstalk to automate build and deployment workflows.

### 7. Vagrant Multi-VM Environment (CentOS Stream 9)

Set up a local development environment using Vagrant and VirtualBox to provision multiple CentOS Stream 9 VMs with private networking, simulating a multi-node setup for testing and development.

### 8. Ansible - DevOps Automation

Studied Ansible fundamentals including playbooks, modules, inventory management, and automation workflows. Gained insight into agentless configuration management and orchestration for diverse systems.

### 9. Continuous Integration with Jenkins

Explored Jenkins installation, configuration, plugins, and the principles of Continuous Integration to automate code builds, tests, and notifications within a collaborative development workflow.

### 10. Terraform AWS Setup

Used Terraform to provision foundational AWS resources including EC2 key pairs and security groups with precise ingress/egress rules, applying Infrastructure as Code best practices.

### 11. Python Exercises Collection

Practiced Python programming through exercises covering conditionals, loops, functions, and other core language features, reinforcing foundational coding skills relevant to automation scripting.
