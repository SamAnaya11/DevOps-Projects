# Continuous Integration with Jenkins

Learned the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) and its purpose in a team development workflow.

Understood the problem of delayed integration and how CI helps by building and testing code on every commit.

Installed Jenkins on an EC2 instance running Ubuntu.

Explored Jenkinsâ€™ key features:

Open-source and extensible with plugins.

Automates code fetch, build, test, and notification on each commit.

Discussed Jenkins plugins for:

Version control integration (e.g., Git)

Build tools (Java, .NET, Node.js, etc.)

Testing and cloud automation

Saw how Jenkins can be used for CI/CD, automated testing, cloud automation, and more.

Prepared to integrate Jenkins with Windows environments in future steps.
