Ansible - DevOps Automation

Started learning Ansible as a DevOps automation tool.

Understood the history and evolution of automation tools:

From Bash/Batch scripting → Python/PowerShell → Puppet/Chef/SaltStack → Ansible.

Learned the differences between traditional configuration management tools (like Puppet and Chef) and Ansible.

Noted key features of Ansible:

No agent required (uses SSH for Linux, WinRM for Windows).

Control machine-based (no Ansible server or services).

Written in YAML (playbooks are simple and human-readable).

Python-based execution (creates and runs Python scripts under the hood).

Explored Ansible use cases:

System and cloud automation (Linux, Windows, AWS, etc.)

Configuration management

Application/service provisioning

Orchestration

Change management

Learned how Ansible connects to different types of targets (Linux, Windows, cloud APIs, network devices).

Understood the role of the inventory file (IP addresses, credentials, etc.).

Learned how modules and playbooks are used to perform tasks.

Discussed the concept of local vs. remote execution depending on the target.

Prepared to start hands-on work with Ansible playbooks and modules in upcoming steps.
