# VProfile Containerization Project

This project showcases how I containerized the VProfile application stack using Docker and Docker Compose. The goal was to shift from traditional VM-based deployments to a clean, portable, and scalable container-based architecture — ideal for DevOps and modern CI/CD workflows.

Project Overview
The VProfile application consists of multiple microservices that work together to deliver a full-stack Java web application. Each of these services was containerized to run independently but in a unified environment:
•	Nginx – Reverse proxy
•	Tomcat – Java application server (hosts the .war file)
•	MySQL – Relational database
•	Memcached – Caching layer
•	RabbitMQ – Message broker
Using Docker, I created custom images where needed. Docker Compose orchestrates all five services, enabling a seamless local deployment with a single command.

Step-by-Step Workflow
Here’s a breakdown of the end-to-end containerization process:
1. Understanding the Traditional Setup
Before diving into containers, I first understood how to deploy the VProfile stack using traditional VMs or manual local setups. This helped identify:
•	Dependencies for each service
•	Configuration requirements
•	Networking and data persistence
2. Choosing the Right Base Images
Based on the stack, I selected appropriate base images from Docker Hub:
•	tomcat for the application server
•	nginx for reverse proxy
•	mysql for the database
•	Official images for memcached and rabbitmq
3. Writing Dockerfiles
Three services required customization, so I wrote Dockerfiles for each:
•	Tomcat: Copied the .war file and configured the app
•	Nginx: Added a custom reverse proxy config
•	MySQL: Loaded schema, tables, and sample data using SQL scripts
4. Building Docker Images
Using the command:
bash
CopyEdit
docker build -t <tag-name> .
I built each image, layering my customizations on top of the base images.
5. Orchestrating with Docker Compose
I created a docker-compose.yml file to define and run the full stack:
•	Linked all services
•	Set port mappings and environment variables
•	Declared dependencies between containers
With this file, spinning up the stack was as simple as:
bash
CopyEdit
docker-compose up -d
6. Testing and Validation
After launching, I tested the full application stack to ensure proper communication among services and full functionality of the VProfile app.
7. Publishing to Docker Hub
Once everything worked as expected, I pushed the custom images to Docker Hub for future reuse and integration:
bash
CopyEdit
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/<image-name>

Outcome
This project was a hands-on implementation of core DevOps and containerization principles. By containerizing each part of the VProfile stack:
•	The stack became portable, scalable, and easy to deploy
•	Setup time dropped from minutes/hours to seconds
•	It’s now fully CI/CD-ready and can be integrated into platforms like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or deployed on Kubernetes
